# RecorD

An online screen recorder without login

## Why did I make this?

Sometimes I need to record something from my screen. Because there is no default software for screen recording, downloading another software would be a waste of memory as I only need to use it once for a while.

#### But there is [ScreenApp.IO](https://screenapp.io/)?

The output video from this website is in `.webm` format, so I have to convert it to `.mp4`, and I'm too lazy for that

also to learn qwik framework

#### Note

This is already working but `.mp4` format won't work in firefox, because `h264 codec` doesn't
supported in firefox. So if I want to record in `.mp4` format. I need to use another browser.
Bruh.

Maybe i will make an API to convert file with `ffmpeg` from cloud like [CloudConvert API](https://cloudconvert.com/api/). 
But i'm not that smart.

Or i will use [CloudConvert API](https://cloudconvert.com/api/) free version 
with only 25 files / day.

At least I can still use this.
