### Online Screen Recorder

## Why did I make this?

Sometimes I need to record something from my screen, because there is no default software for screen recording, downloading another software would be a waste of time as I only need to use it once for a while.

#### But there is [ScreenApp.IO](https://screenapp.io/)?

The output video from this website is in `.webm` format, so I have to first convert it to `.mp4`, and I'm too lazy for that
